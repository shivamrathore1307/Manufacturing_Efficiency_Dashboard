📊 Manufacturing Efficiency Dashboard | Power BI Project
Welcome to my Power BI Manufacturing Dashboard Project, where data meets decision-making! This dashboard offers a comprehensive view of manufacturing operations, providing real-time insights into production efficiency, defect rates, downtime, and operator/machine performance.

🛠️ Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed an annual dataset from a manufacturing plant that includes:

Shift-wise production data

Machine and operator performance

Defect analysis

Downtime tracking

Efficiency rate monitoring

The goal is to empower stakeholders with actionable insights to improve overall productivity and operational efficiency.

📌 Key Metrics Tracked
📦 Total Production: 1.87 Million+ units

❌ Total Defects: 32.9K units

⏱️ Total Downtime: 3182 hours

⚙️ Average Efficiency Rate: 78.39%

📉 Defect Percentage: 1.76%

🛑 Downtime Percentage: 3.62%
